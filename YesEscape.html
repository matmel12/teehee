	<p> <strong> Terms of Service </strong></p>
	
	<p> In order to move on you <strong>must</strong> read <strong>all</strong> of the terms of services.</p>
	
<p> HAVE ELEVATOR MUSIC PLAYING 
	
	These Terms of Use (or "Terms") govern your use of Escape, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Escape Service (the "Service"), outlined below. When you create an Escape or use Escape, you agree to these terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Also Facebook kinda sucks but like whatever that is another conversation for another time. Keep reading because this stuff is importan... or the at least the length of this sh*t  will scare you into thinking that this stuff is important.

	<p>
	The Escape Service is one of the Escape Products, provided to you NOT by Facebook, Inc. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and defintitely not Facebook, Inc. 

ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION BELOW. ALSO DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE HECK ARBITRATION MEANS CAUSE I DONT. WHY AM I YELLING?
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents, but definitely not including Instagram LLC or Facebook, can invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a dispute. Otherwise, this agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.

	Statements composed by those of large corporations relay the sense that whomever scripted important? documents or agreements, such as terms of uses, use a theasarus to appear to seem of great intelligence. Or perhaps others just read dumb. Yeah. Words.

	USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY: Devices that open these sites have no power to sue Escape. Whatever that means. If you read these you will notice this, but I don't want to keep typing boring sh*t so i am going to copy and paste like the flawed creature I am.

	CONTINUATION OF THE PASTE OF THE COPY: The Escape Service is one of the Escape Products, provided to you NOT by Facebook, Inc. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and defintitely not Facebook, Inc. ALSO: We have every right to sell your soul and take and x-ray of your heart or of your cat. The whole "sell-your-soul" part is something we are still trying to master but I think it could work. Hopefully you didn't read this part. Seriously, if you are, what the heck are you doing? Either you are an extremely bored human being or you actually take the time to read these things like the smart as heck individual you are.
